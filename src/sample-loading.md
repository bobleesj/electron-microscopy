# Sample Loading

> Disclaimer: This guide is written for those who have already used single-tilt and double-tilt, tomography holders. If you are using this documentation for the first time, you should work with a supervisor.

## Location

**TITAN:**

Sample loading is done outside of the room where Titan is hosted:

**Spectra 300:**

Sample loading can be done inside the Spectra room:

Sample holders are stored here at room te

## Single-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

> FIXME: use technical terms for these objects... "pin" or "clip"?

1. Push the pin inside the tiny hole shown below:

2. Lift the clip gently:

3. If using a copper grid, pinch the tip of the copper grid

4. Place the sample, shiny side up for the standard sample

## Double-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

1. Load the sample and washer (gold donut):

2. Add the cap and rotate the holder about the long axis to ensure the sample is secure:

**Unload sample:**

1. Press down the very small hole gently as shown below:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/03-holder-locked.jpg" alt="Holder locked" width="500">

2. The three parts should all be disassembled and placed on the bottom:

## Tomography holder

**Unload sample**

1. The sample grid is held between the two "arms" of the metal strips.

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/01-sample-loaded.jpg" alt="Sample grid held by metal strips" width="500">

2. Rotate the screw counterclockwise about 90 degrees. Repeat for the other "arm".

3. Move the two strips away from each other to free the sample

     From:

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/03-strips-closed.jpg" alt="Strips close together" width="500">

     To:

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/04-strips-open.jpg" alt="Strips moved apart" width="500">

4. Remove the sample

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/05-sample-removed.jpg" alt="Sample removed" width="500">

**Load sample**

Follow the process in reverse: load a new sample, pull the two strips closer together, and rotate the screws clockwise.

## Start session

> Use this section when inserting a holder at the beginning of any session.

1. Push the holder in until you feel resistance. The turbo pump will start automatically.

2. Wait 2 minutes for pressure to stabilize. Notice the time in `TEMUI`.

3. Turn counter-clockwise until you feel gently stuck.

4. Guide the holder to push in. Expect the holder to move in smoothly.

5. In `TEMUI`, turn off the turbo pump.

## End session

> Use this section when finishing any session (STEM, EELS, EDS, 4D-STEM, etc.).

1. Set magnification to lower SA range (< 10,000×).

2. For Titan, expand the beam to larger circle fluorescent screen.

3. In `TEMUI`, press `Column Valves Closed`.

4. In `TEMUI`, press `Reset Holder`.

5. Pull the holder straight out to the first resistance point.

6. Turn clockwise, then pull the rest out continuously.

7. Unload the sample from the holder using the appropriate section above (single-tilt, double-tilt, or tomography).
