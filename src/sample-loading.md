# Sample Loading

> Disclaimer: This guide is written for those who have already used single-tilt and double-tilt, tomography holders. If you are using this documentation for the first time, you should work with a supervisor.

## Location

**TITAN:**

Sample loading is done outside of the room where Titan is hosted:

**Spectra 300:**

Sample loading can be done inside the Spectra room:

Sample holders are stored here at room te

## Single-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

> FIXME: use technical terms for these objects... "pin" or "clip"?

1. Push the pin inside the tiny hole shown below:

2. Lift the clip gently:

3. If using a copper grid, pinch the tip of the copper grid

4. Place the sample, shiny side up for the standard sample

## Double-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

1. Load the sample and washer (gold donut):

2. Add the cap and rotate the holder about the long axis to ensure the sample is secure:

**Unload sample:**

1. Press down the very small hole gently as shown below:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/03-holder-locked.jpg" alt="Holder locked" width="500">

2. The three parts should all be disassembled and placed on the bottom:

## Tomography holder

**Unload sample**

1. The sample grid is held between the two "arms" of the metal strips.

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/01-sample-loaded.jpg" alt="Sample grid held by metal strips" width="500">

2. Rotate the screw counterclockwise about 90 degrees. Repeat for the other "arm".

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/02-rotate-screw.jpg" alt="Rotating screw counterclockwise" width="500">

3. Move the two strips away from each other to free the sample

     From:

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/03-strips-closed.jpg" alt="Strips close together" width="500">

     To:

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/04-strips-open.jpg" alt="Strips moved apart" width="500">

4. Remove the sample

     <img src="img/sample-loading/tomography/05-sample-removed.jpg" alt="Sample removed" width="500">

**Load sample**

Follow the process in reverse: load a new sample, pull the two strips closer together, and rotate the screws clockwise.

## How to remove and insert holder

**Insert holder**

- Push the holder in, feel resistance. This will start the turbo pump immediately.

- Wait 2 minutes, turn counter-clockwise until you feel gently stuck
- Guide the holder to push in. Expect the holder to move in.
- On TEMUI, turn off turbo pump

**Remove holder**

- Press `Reset holder` in TEMUI.
- Close column valves in TEMUI.
- Pull the holder straight out up to the point shown above, turn clockwise, pull the rest out continuously.
