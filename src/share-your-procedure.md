# Share Your Procedure

We want to bring electron microscopy techniques and SOPs together across institutions.

## Why contribute?

- **Seamless experiments** - Researchers traveling between facilities can quickly get up to speed on different microscopes
- **Reduced friction** - Standardized visual guides reduce training time and errors
- **Community knowledge** - Your expertise helps the broader EM community

## What we're looking for

- Step-by-step operating procedures for your microscope
- Visual guides with screenshots or photos
- Tips and tricks from experienced operators
- Troubleshooting guides

## How to contribute

We can help with writing, formatting, and organizing your content. You don't need to be a programmer!

1. **Prepare your notes** - Word docs, Google Docs, handwritten notes, photos from your phone - anything works
2. **Reach out** - Contact [@bobleesj](https://github.com/bobleesj) or open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bobleesj/electron-microscopy)
3. **We'll handle the rest** - We'll format your content and add it to the site under your institution's section

## Institutions we'd love to hear from

- National labs
- University facilities
- Industry labs
- International facilities

Your procedures will be credited to you and your institution.
