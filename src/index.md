# Electron Microscopy Training (WIP)

WIP:

- [ ] Use real screenshots instead of pictures.
- [ ] Better pictures: proportion, focus, FOV
- [ ] More visuals added to each session when needed

Disclaimer: Always follow [https://barnum.su.domains/](https://barnum.su.domains/) for correctness. Only use this documentation if you are working with the authors of the document and you are looking for quick visual references.

The content is meant to be used as a step-by-step tutorial focused on practice sitting in front of the microscope with a focus on visual elements.
